    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix}
        The data to center and scale.
    axis : int (0 by default)
        axis used to compute the means and standard deviations along. If 0,
        independently standardize each feature, otherwise (if 1) standardize
        each sample.
    with_mean : boolean, True by default
        If True, center the data before scaling.
    with_std : boolean, True by default
        If True, scale the data to unit variance (or equivalently,
        unit standard deviation).
    copy : boolean, optional, default True
        set to False to perform inplace row normalization and avoid a
        copy (if the input is already a numpy array or a scipy.sparse
        CSC matrix and if axis is 1).
    Notes
    -----
    This implementation will refuse to center scipy.sparse matrices
    since it would make them non-sparse and would potentially crash the
    program with memory exhaustion problems.
    Instead the caller is expected to either set explicitly
    `with_mean=False` (in that case, only variance scaling will be
    performed on the features of the CSC matrix) or to call `X.toarray()`
    if he/she expects the materialized dense array to fit in memory.
    To avoid memory copy the caller should pass a CSC matrix.

class StandardNANScaler(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    """Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance
    Centering and scaling happen independently on each feature by computing
    the relevant statistics on the samples in the training set. Mean and
    standard deviation are then stored to be used on later data using the
    `transform` method.
    Standardization of a dataset is a common requirement for many
    machine learning estimators: they might behave badly if the
    individual feature do not more or less look like standard normally
    distributed data (e.g. Gaussian with 0 mean and unit variance).
    For instance many elements used in the objective function of
    a learning algorithm (such as the RBF kernel of Support Vector
    Machines or the L1 and L2 regularizers of linear models) assume that
    all features are centered around 0 and have variance in the same
    order. If a feature has a variance that is orders of magnitude larger
    that others, it might dominate the objective function and make the
    estimator unable to learn from other features correctly as expected.
    This scaler can also be applied to sparse CSR or CSC matrices by passing
    `with_mean=False` to avoid breaking the sparsity structure of the data.
    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <preprocessing_scaler>`.
    Parameters
    ----------
    copy : boolean, optional, default True
        If False, try to avoid a copy and do inplace scaling instead.
        This is not guaranteed to always work inplace; e.g. if the data is
        not a NumPy array or scipy.sparse CSR matrix, a copy may still be
        returned.
    with_mean : boolean, True by default
        If True, center the data before scaling.
        This does not work (and will raise an exception) when attempted on
        sparse matrices, because centering them entails building a dense
        matrix which in common use cases is likely to be too large to fit in
        memory.
    with_std : boolean, True by default
        If True, scale the data to unit variance (or equivalently,
        unit standard deviation).
    Attributes
    ----------
    scale_ : ndarray, shape (n_features,)
        Per feature relative scaling of the data.
        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           *scale_*
    mean_ : array of floats with shape [n_features]
        The mean value for each feature in the training set.
    var_ : array of floats with shape [n_features]
        The variance for each feature in the training set. Used to compute
        `scale_`
    n_samples_seen_ : int
        The number of samples processed by the estimator. Will be reset on
        new calls to fit, but increments across ``partial_fit`` calls.
    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    >>>
    >>> data = [[0, 0], [0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 1]]
    >>> scaler = StandardScaler()
    >>> print(scaler.fit(data))
    StandardScaler(copy=True, with_mean=True, with_std=True)
    >>> print(scaler.mean_)
    [ 0.5  0.5]
    >>> print(scaler.transform(data))
    [[-1. -1.]
     [-1. -1.]
     [ 1.  1.]
     [ 1.  1.]]
    >>> print(scaler.transform([[2, 2]]))
